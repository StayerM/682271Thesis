# Code for the Master's thesis "“Analyzing the impact of Executive Sentiment and Buzzword Overuse in Earnings Calls on Stock Performance" by Maksimilian Štajer [max.stajer@gmail.com](mailto:max.stajer@gmail.com).

This reposotory contains the python and SQL code used to carry out the research for my master's thesis, as the code is not meant to be run multiple times (aside from reproduction purposes) it has not been cleaned or optimized.
